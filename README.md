# Get Endorsements From NexusMods

This application calls the NexusMods API for a specified mod, returns the current number of endorsements on that mod, and creates/appends data.json with an incremented unique identifier, the datetime, and number of endorsements.

To configure, either edit the program.py credential variables with your specific credentials or edit the sample_cred_lib.py file similarly and rename to cred_lib.py.
